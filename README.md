Overview
The Green Finance Platform is a blockchain-cloud integrated system designed to bridge investors and innovators in the green finance sector. It leverages AI-driven ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) validation using NLP transformers (e.g., EnvironmentalBERT) and blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in funding eco-friendly projects.

Key Features
AI-Driven ESG Validation: Uses EnvironmentalBERT and NLP pipelines to assess project sustainability.

Blockchain Integration: Secures transparent collaboration between innovators and investors using smart contracts.

Privacy-First Architecture: Innovator and investor data are separated and connected via APIs for real-time sharing.

Unified Tech Stack: Combines blockchain security, AI analytics, and cloud agility to streamline capital flow.

Tech Stack
Python: EnvironmentalBERT & NLP pipelines

Solidity: Smart contracts and rules for the blockchain

Web3.py: Bridges blockchain network

FastAPI: Manages secure REST APIs for cross-platform data transfer

AWS S3: Stores project documents and audit trails

TensorFlow: Trains custom ESG evaluation models
